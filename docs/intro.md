# Welcome to this FastAPI series

FastAPI is a Python web framework that is **high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production** according to the official documentation. FastAPI is currently one of the most popular web frameworks second to Django (if we are measuring popularity by Github stars)

In this course, I will teach you everything you will need to get running and start developing robust APIs using this tool. My name is Ssali Jonathan Kiggundu. I am software Engineer based in Uganda. 

I love to teach programming to people. I have been doing this for the past two years using my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SsaliJonathan). I hope you learn from this course.
